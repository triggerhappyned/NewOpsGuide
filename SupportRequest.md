# Submitting a Support Request to VRCAVE

Before you do anything, check if your issue is described here: [Troubleshooting Quest](troubleshooting_Quest.md) 
<!---
When something happens to either vrcave or the Quest 2 headsets, It is important to get as much information on the issue as possible. 

### Things to keep track of when something goes wrong

 1. keep track of how often this issue happens, does it happen consistently? Does it happen once in a while? did it only happen once?
 2. Is the issue happening on just one device or all the devices? Is it happening to random devices without consistency?
 3. Are you able to get a photo or video of the issue? If there is an error message related to the issue, photos of it really help with troubleshooting.

 ### Things to include in an email to support
 
 To provide the best service, include as much detail about your issue as possible. Here are some examples of things that can help us identify a solution (some of the questions may not make sense in relation to your issue, just include what you can)
 
 - **How often does the issue happen?** Does something specific cause the issue to happen? (for example, does the issue happen when the game changes levels?)
 - **Is the issue happening to one specific device or all devices?**
 - **Is it possible to take a screenshot or video of the issue and send it to support?**
 - **Can you describe what the headset sees when this is happening?**
