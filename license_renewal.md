## How to renew your license

1. **Keep your server computer connected to the Internet.** We have automated our license system so that your VRCAVE license should update automatically every time you start the VRCave Library server. 


### How to Manually Send Game Data for a License Renewal 

- *If you do not have an internet connection for your server computer, this is how you can request an extention to your license*
 
 1. Go to your vrcave folder and follow this path: vrcave\WindowsNoEditor\VRcaveLibrary\Saved\SaveGames
 *For vrcaveLite: vrcave\WindowsNoEditor\VRcaveLibrary\Saved\SaveGames*

 2. Copy the file *gameRecords.sav* and save it somewhere for later.

 3. Email [support@vrcave.ca](mailto:support@vrcave.ca) that you want a license update and attach the gameRecords.sav file.

 4. We will communicate with you if you need to provide more.


### Manually Applying the License File

 1. When you receive your new license .bat file, save the .bat to your desktop, (or the same folder as your vrcave *or vrcaveLite* folder).
