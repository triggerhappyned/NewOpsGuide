# Runaway Train

## Narrative

*Dr. Steem has escaped and is planning his revenge against the town that has imprisoned him. He plans to load up his train with dynamite and blow it up when it reaches the town!*

----

## Puzzle Solutions

### Train Pursuit Car

*Before boarding Dr. Steem's train, the defense drones need to be destroyed. Use the state-of-the-art, steam-powered Gatling gun to clear the way.*

This section's objective is to shoot down all the drones using the gun in the center of the room. The levers on either side of the gun are used to adjust rotation and pitch of the turret. 

**Phase 1:** Load ammo into the gun, aim at a drone and pull the lever below the gun to fire. Once 3 drones are destroyed, the next phase begins.

**Phase 2:** A well placed shot by the enemy drones has disabled the gun. Players must solve the pipe puzzle to restore rotation control to the gun to finish destroying the drones. In normal mode, the solution layout of the pipes is visible on the opposite side of the train car. 


### Caboose Forge

*The caboose appears to be Dr. Steem's mobile forge and the door to the rest of the train is locked by a strange mechanism that requires pipes made from copper. There must be a way to gather enough copper to move forward...*

Players must use the smelter, the forge, and the various recipes in the room to gather all 6 copper ingots scattered throught the room. 
Items can be forged by inserting the required ingots into the forge and setting the **T P K** dials before pulling the forge lever. **T P K** code and ingredients are shown in recipes scattered about the room. 

The forge and the smelter both require a gear to operate. 

- **List of Recipes**
  
  
| Item      | Metal Components | Forge Code | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Big Wrench | 1 Fe | (T=5, P=5, K=6) | |
| Brass Clock | 1 Cu + 1 Zn | (T=6, P=0, K=5) | |
| Brass Gramophone Bell | 1 Cu + 1 Zn | (T=2, P=9, K=7) | used on the locked safe to help open it |
| Copper Gear | 1 Cu | (T=9, P=6, K=2) | used to make smelter and forge work |
| Copper Pipe | 1 Cu |(T=7, P=7, K=7) | used to get final door open|
| Copper Statue | 1 Cu | (T=4, P=5, K=4) | |
| Copper Teapot | 1 Cu | (T=8, P=9, K=2) | |
| Golden Crown | 1 Au | (T=0, P=7, K=9) | |
| Hover Drone | 1 Au + 1 Ag + 1 Zn | (T=2, P=5, K=6) | used to retrieve copper ingot stuck in ceiling|
| Iron Gear | 2 Fe | (T=1, P=5, K=7) | used to make smelter and forge work|
| Iron Hammer | 1 Fe | (T=7, P=4, K=1) | |
| Iron Magnet| 2 Fe | (T=6, P=4, K=9) | used to control iron objects|
| Silver Statue | 1 Ag | (T=3, P=3, K=1) | |



**Copper 1: Already in the lock** This one is aleady a pipe, and inserted in the door lock to demonstrate the overall goal.

**Copper 2: Clock** A clock on one of the tables can be melted into a copper and zinc ingot.  

**Copper 3: In the ceiling** This ingot requires multiple steps to retrieve it. The players must open the safe, which requires players to first forge a gramophone bell and attach it to the safe. Attaching the gramophone bell allows players to listen for the "click" sounds when turning the dials that indicate the correct numbers to unlock the safe. Once the safe is open, players will have the required gold, silver and zinc to forge a flying drone. The flying drone can be piloted using a controller in the room, and can be used to push the the copper ingot that is stuck along the ceiling.

**Copper 4: Ingot behind the glass** Players must forge a magnet with two iron ingots. The remaining iron object (either an iron ingot, hammer, or wrench) can be placed behind the glass and controlled with the magnet. Players can navigate this iron object so that it pushes the copper ingot out from behind the glass. 

**Copper 5 and 6: Copper gears** Players must forge an iron gear, then use that gear on the smelter to melt both of the copper gears provided. The iron gear can be moved to the forge to make the copper pipes. 



### Engine Room

*The Deputies job has only just begun, they must stop this train before it reaches the town.*

The goal of the engine room is to destroy all the fuses in the room. There is a crate of bombs, and a rack of revolvers for the players to use in this task.

There are three fuses that can be shot right away, one in the ceiling, and two on the walls opposite of each other. 

The fuse in the floor cannot be shot, players must drop a bomb in the floor grate, and shoot the bomb through the floor grate track until it is under the glass. The bomb will explode and destroy the fuse. 

The fuse in the glass chamber behind the fence can also be destroyed by a bomb. first shoot the red valve handle a few times until it stops turning, then place a bomb in the pipe opening to the right of that valve. The bomb will be pushed through the pipe and fall slowly in front of another pipe opening. Players must shoot the bomb in mid-air so that it is knocked into the open pipe. It will then explode and destroy the fuse. 

The fuse behind glass panels can be shot once the panels have been moved. The first 2 fuses require the **A** levers to be activated in the correct order, the order is scratched into the side of each lever. They can be activate by hand, gun barrel, or bullet. once all 4 have been activated, the glass panel will slide out of the way of the first fuse, which can be shot directly. the second fuse can be shot by shooting at the glass and ricocheting the bullet into the fuse. 

The last fuse can be accessed by activating the **B** levers in the correct order. All of these levers are out of reach and can only be activated by shooting them. 


###  Dr. Steem

*The town is safe now that the train has stopped, but Dr. Steem is not done with the deputies...*

This is the final showdown with Dr. Steem. Players will have to shoot the green furnace on his jetpack, which requires players to either hit him as he flies past, or stun him with explosions. 

##### Boss Fight Sequence


**Phase 1:** Dr. Steem will fly above the play area and drop bombs into the area. Players can shoot the bomb in his hand to stun him, causing him to rotate around and expose his weak spot. Alternatively, they can shoot the weakspot as he flies through the play area. 

**Phase 2:** Dr. Steem will now use the Gatling gun on his arm to attack the players, and drones will start flying around the train. Players must either shoot the dynamite off the drone or destroy the drone itself above Dr. Steem to stun him and expose his weak spot. 

**Phase 3:** Drones with glass shields will surround the train, shooting the sheilds will ricochet the bullets into the bosses weak spot when fired at the correct angle.
