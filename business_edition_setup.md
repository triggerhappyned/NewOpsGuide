 You can turn on *Kiosk Mode* if you don't want your players to be able to close the game. It will make the headset start the game on startup and the only thing players can do is restart the app.
 
 If you want to run other apps besides VRCAVE Library, then Kiosk mode is not for you. 
 
 Once the app is added to the device manager, the Quests should automatically update.
