## Updating to the Latest vrCAVE Library Version

*The best way to ensure a clean version is to first delete the exist software folder, and replacing it with the new version*

On the server computer:
1. Download the latest vrCAVE Library software and unzip the folder using the URL provided to you from vrCAVE.

2. Delete the old vrcaveLite folder from the desktop

3. Unzip the new vrCAVE Library software so that the vrcaveLite folder is located on the desktop

For each Quest headset:
1. Plug the headset into the computer using a USB cable

2. Navigate to the vrcaveLiteFolder, and click into the Android_ASTC folder.

3. Double click the **Install_VRcaveLibrary-arm64.bat** and let the script run. You will see a progress percentage, and the window will close on it's own when it is completed.
