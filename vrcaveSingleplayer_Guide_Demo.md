# vrCAVE Singleplay Setup


**NOTE: This is for demo purposes only**


## Navigating within VRcaveLibrary

In typical use, vrCAVE running on an PC Backpack connects to a Windows PC running the vrCAVE Server, and the game operator controls all navigation (switching between escape rooms, launching the auto intro, etc.) from the server PC.

For this scenario of trying out vrCAVE demo without a server PC, you’ll need to take some extra steps to select and launch the game from within VR, and skip through the rooms.

## Activating Single Player Mode

- First, to unlock the operator controls (which are not intended to be available to players), tap the following physical buttons on your Vive hand controllers: 


- **Right_Menu_Click , Right_Trackpad_Click , Right_Trackpad_Click , Right_Menu_Click , Left_Menu_Click , Left_Trackpad_Click , Left_Menu_Click**

- Or to reference the image above (R and L is Right Controller and Left Controller respectively): **R1, R2, R2, R1, L1, L2, L1**

- Next, press **Left_Trackpad_Click** to open the operator menu. From now on, you can close or open the operator menu with the **Left_Trackpad_Click** button.
- From here, point your right hand controller at the **VRcave at Home**, click the right trigger to activate it.
