## Pre-game User Instructions

### Technical Description

(After all players and suited up and are waiting in the starting green squares)

Welcome to VR!  For this experience, the only controls you need worry about are the triggers you use with your index fingers; this opens and closes your hands and is used to grab objects. If your hands every disappear or drift away during the game, this means that someone is blocking the controllers and waving them lightly above your head should bring them back. Similarly, if your headset goes white-grey this means that someone is standing too close to you, and you will need to spread out a bit more. Everyone notice the virtual walls around them, please don’t reach through them or over virtual railings. There are physical walls on the other side, and they will hurt if you walk into them. A thin red line will appear to warn you when you get to close. And finally, no running, no jumping, and be sure to give each other lots of space. Everyone ready for their mission…
